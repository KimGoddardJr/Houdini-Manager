# Houdini-Tractor-Submit

A merger from the HTTP based method used in the maya submitter and a custom GUI created specifically for Houdini Submission handling.
This plugin only works in in the work environment it was created for, with a couple of tweaks it can be fitted to be used in another environment though.

Git clone this into your Houdini packages folder,add a '.json'-file named after the folder and add {"path" : "$HOUDINI_PACKAGE_PATH/Houdini-Tractor-Submit"}.
